## Introduction

A repository containing code to generate digital maps. This repo
relies heavily on excellent mapping tools in R. Currently, I am
generating minimalist topographic maps, but I might expand to
other types in the future.

## Contents

* `analysis/`: Core components of the analysis
* `data/`: Elevation data as `Rds` files
* `img/`: Final maps as images
* `src/`: Functions and source files
